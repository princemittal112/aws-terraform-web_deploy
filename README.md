# 🚀 AWS Static Website Deployment using Terraform & Nginx

This project demonstrates deploying a static HTML website on AWS using **Terraform** and **Nginx**. The infrastructure includes a custom VPC, public/private subnets, and an EC2 instance running Nginx. Terraform uses **S3 + DynamoDB** for remote backend and state locking.

---

## 🧱 What’s Included

- 🏗️ Terraform for full infrastructure automation
- 🌐 Custom VPC with public/private subnets
- 🛡️ Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, and route tables
- 🖥️ EC2 instance hosting Nginx
- 💾 S3 bucket for Terraform remote state
- 🔒 DynamoDB table for state locking

## What is a Terraform Backend?

A backend is where Terraform stores its state file. It is responsible for:
- Keeping track of resources Terraform creates
- Allowing multiple people to work on the same infrastructure
- Managing state file locking to avoid corruption

---

## 🔁 Backend Configuration (terraform block)

⚠️ These resources must be created first on aws, as Terraform needs them before init. So, we go to aws console and create an s3 bucket named "my-terraform-state-bucket-prince" and a dynamodb_table named "terraform-lock-table-prince"

---

## 🏗️ Main Infrastructure Deployment

### Once the backend exists:
- Add the backend block in a new project
- Run terraform init to migrate state
- Add VPC, subnet, EC2, security groups, and Nginx provisioning

### EC2 Setup + Nginx
- sudo dnf update -y
- sudo dnf install nginx -y
- sudo systemctl start nginx
- sudo systemctl enable nginx
- Deploy HTML and Access in browser: http:<//EC2-PUBLIC-IP>
